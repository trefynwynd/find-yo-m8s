# Find yo' m8s

The purpose is to "search for your m8s" in 8 seconds by finding matching pairs of them.

How to play:

1) Press the "Begin" button to show the board.
2) Using your mouse, click on one of the cards.
3) Click on another card to see whether it matches.
4) If it does match, then you have found one of your m8s.
5) If it does not match, then the cards will flip back and you will have search out again.
6) Continue flipping cards until you find all of your m8s before the timer runs out.


This is what it'll look like when complete:
